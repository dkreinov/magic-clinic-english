CURRENT: phase 1 "the item contract, the mechanical gate, and a pilot the owner reviews", next step 1.1
PLAN: .oplan/word-quiz/plan.md — fixed in place through THREE review rounds, so there is no
  amendments appendix to read separately. Read it top to bottom.
DESIGN: .oplan/word-quiz/design.md — FROZEN. 14 owner decisions (D1-D14) from a grill-me pass plus
  5 orchestrator decisions (D15-D19). Do not re-open any of them.
FIELD GUIDE: .oplan/word-quiz/field-guide/index.md (13 lessons, re-curated from word-audio)
PREDECESSOR: .oplan/word-audio/ — closed and deployed. Its journal holds the deploy recipe, the
  rollback procedure, and the two gate failures this run must not repeat.

BASE: commit ceca519 · 208 tests / 0 fail · contrast 52 ALL PASS · LIVE at magic-vet-v12.

ACCEPTED: (none yet — no step has been executed)

FROZEN CONTRACTS IN FORCE: QZ-1 (the item file, ten rules — 1/2/9 FILE-level, 3-8/10 ITEM-level)
  · QZ-2 (the generation rules, including the vocabulary warning and the duty to self-run the gate)
  · QZ-3 (the gate's frozen CLI: `[--dir <path>] [--sample <N>]`, item-level sampling, rule-4 errors
    name the offending tokens) · QZ-4 (phase-1 non-goals: no UI, no api/, no lib/profile.js, no
    sw.js, no cache bump, no deploy, no paid API, no runtime LLM) · QZ-5 (the 50 frozen pilot words
    and the frozen 5-batch composition) · QZ-6 (ledger 208 -> 214 -> 218) · QZ-7 (inherited: PRECACHE
    admits first-party JS only, contrast stays at 52, profile never contacted).

THE THREE THINGS MOST LIKELY TO BITE:
  · QZ-1 rule 4 — the allowed vocabulary is NOT ordinary English. MEASURED: `after`, `children`,
    `men`, `women`, `feet` are ABSENT while `before`, `went`, `gone` are present. Workers must check
    every word against public/audio/words/index.json and run the gate themselves.
  · QZ-1 rule 8 — pos is a SET unioned across BOTH bands, matched by intersection. 393 manifest
    lemmas have >1 band entry and 336 have a pos union larger than 1. The `entry.pos == null` guard
    is load-bearing: `String(null)` is the truthy string "null".
  · A green gate is NOT acceptance. Criterion 9 is a HUMAN gate — the gate checks form, the owner
    checks meaning. This project has shipped two defects that passed a mechanically-green gate.

OPEN QUESTIONS: none. All 13 grill questions were answered by the owner; the 5 the grill left open
  were decided by the orchestrator at plan time as D15-D19 and written into design.md.
  NO sensitive-word escalation is expected any more: QZ-8 (owner, D20) removes 37 words from the
  quiz entirely and the pilot list no longer contains any of them. QZ-2's stop-and-ask rule stays as
  a backstop. NOTE the exclusion is QUIZ-ONLY — those words are still in buildAllowedSet and the
  story may still use them; that is flagged in design.md D20 and NOT decided.

BLOCKED: no
